        <h2>A talk by Jim Manico</h2>


        <p>The best time to address secure software is before most developers
            even start writing code. Months&mdash;sometimes years&mdash;before most
            developers even start writing code, various open source or corporate
            developers work together to build software <em>frameworks</em>&mdash;the platforms
            that other developers leverage to build applications.</p>

        <p>The decisions made by <em>framework designers</em> ripple though time and have a large
            impact on the security posture of software that is built upon these
            frameworks.</p>

        <p><b>Bio:</b> Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure
            coding and security engineering. He is also the founder of Brakeman Security, Inc. and is a investor/advisor
            for Signal Sciences. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices and is a member of the JavaOne
            rockstar speaker community. Jim is also a Global Board Member for the OWASP foundation where he helps drive
            the strategic vision for the organization. He is co-author (with August Detlefson) of <a

        <h4 style="margin-top:1em;">About Impostor Syndrome</h4>

        <p>Maria Klawe is a President of a prestigious college, on the board of directors of a major corporation (#35 of
            Fortune 500), and was previously Dean of Engineering at an Ivy League school. These are only a few of her
            impressive accomplishments.</p>


        <p>Yet she, like each of us, has moments when she wonders whether she "belongs".
            Even highly accomplished people sometimes doubt their own abilities. This is
            known as Impostor Syndrome. Stereotypes can play a significant role, but
            Impostor Syndrome can affect anyone.</p>

        <p>Hear from Dr. Klawe, two UCSB senior faculty, a recent UCSB alum and a current CS Undergraduate about their
            experiences with Impostor Syndrome, and how to overcome it. There will be brief panel presentations, and an
            opportunity for Q and A.</p>

        <p>Refreshments will be served.</p>

        <p>

            In the United States and other Western countries, digital communication is instantaneous and ubiquitous.
            However, this is not the case for many parts of the world, especially in rural Africa. Come find out how
            UCSB students and faculty work to bring modern and fast digital communication via wireless networks to
            Zambia with Prof. Belding's VillageNet architecture.

        <h2>Frustration to Innovation</h2>
        <h4>April 9th, 2012<br/>
            Corwin Pavilion - 3:30-5:30 PM</h4>
        <p>What drives inventions in computing? Necessity seems to play only a minor role. Anger at the way things are
            is much more powerful, because it leads to easier ways to work (e.g. the invention of new computer
            languages). A general dissatisfaction with the practical or theoretical structure of the world can open up
            whole new approaches to problems (complexity theory and cryptography). Finally, a genuine collaboration
            between people and machines can lead to an entirely new kind of engineering for devices that will travel to
            far-off planets or to hostile environments.</p>
        <p>The talk will discuss the work of several inventors in computing and engineering, their inventions, and how
            they came up with them and how they plan to come up with more in the future. The ensuing discussion will
            address the fundamental nature of invention in a world partly populated by intelligent machines.</p>
        <p>Bio:<br/>Dennis Shasha is a professor of computer science at the Courant Institute of New York University
            where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for microarrays, combinatorial design, network
            inference, and protein docking; with physicists, musicians, and financial people on algorithms for time
            series; and on database applications in untrusted environments. Other areas of interest include database
            tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles
            about a mathematical detective, a biography about great computer scientists, and technical books about
            database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, and statistics. He has co-authored over sixty
            journal papers, seventy conference papers, and fifteen patents. He has written the puzzle column for various
            publications including Scientific American. He is co-author of Natural Computing.</p>

            the Okori Group, Brian co-founded and led the technology team in a number of successful startup companies,
            In his career as a consultant he has completed a variety of high profile projects, including the world's
            first Internet banking system for Wells Fargo in 1995. In 1985 Fox was the first employee of the Free
            Software Foundation (Project GNU) where he worked with Richard Stallman. During his tenure at the FSF, Fox
            authored the BASH shell, widely used in all modern version of *NIX, GNU Makeinfo, GNU Info, GNU Finger, and

        <h3>Designing Safe Software for Medicine</h3>
        <h4>April 15, 2011</h4>
        <p>Today it would be difficult to find a medical device that does not critically rely on computer software in
            its function, manufacture, or use in clinical decision making. Despite the lessons learned by the radiation
            accidents of the Therac-25 twenty years ago, medical devices that rely on software (e.g., drug infusion
            pumps, linear accelerators for radiation) continue to injure or kill patients in preventable ways.</p>
        <p>Kevin Fu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts
            Amherst. Kevin's research has led to improvements in security and privacy of pervasive devices, promoting
            the vision of safer and more effective technology for consumers. Kevin received his Ph.D. in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has served on numerous
            program committees of leading conferences in computer security, and has given dozens of invited talks
            world-wide to industry, government, and academia on the topic of security and privacy. Kevin is an Alfred P.
            Sloan Research Fellow, NSF CAREER Award recipient, and MIT Technology Review TR35 Innovator of the Year. He
            also holds a certificate of achievement in artisanal bread making from the French Culinary Institute.</p>
